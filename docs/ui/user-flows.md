## Flow 1  Public "Try Before Sign Up" (Prescription)

No account required. User gets full AI explanation, then is prompted to save.

```
[01] Landing homepage  /
  ↓  "Try Free Upload" CTA
[02] File picker  /upload  (Step 1/3)
  ↓  Upload photo / PDF / enter manually
[03] OCR processing  (Step 2a  spinner, "Reading your prescription…")
  ↓  OCR resolves → document_type = prescription
[04] Prescription review  (Step 2b  "Check the Details")
     User can edit any field before confirming
  ↓  "Yes, This Looks Right →"
[05] AI explanation loading  (Step 3a  "Preparing your explanation…")
  ↓  /api/explain returns PrescriptionExplanation
[06] Prescription explanation  (Step 3b  MedicationCards + DoctorNotes)
  ↓  "Save to My Account  Free"  →  saves to localStorage as nuskha_pending_upload
  ↓  redirect → /auth?mode=signup&return=/dashboard

[10] Auth  sign up  /auth
  ↓  email+password or Google OAuth
[Onboarding] Enter full name  /onboarding
  ↓  submit
[12] Dashboard  /dashboard
     PendingUploadBanner fires automatically:
       reads localStorage → calls savePendingUpload() → saves to DB with explanation
       shows success toast → localStorage cleared
```

**Error paths:**
- OCR returns "not a medical document" → modal overlay → user tries again (stays on Step 1)
- AI explanation API fails → error screen with "Try Again" + "Go back to check details"
- User closes browser before saving → localStorage persists, banner fires on next login

---

## Flow 2  Public "Try Before Sign Up" (Lab Report)

Same entry as Flow 1, but lab report takes a different path  skips review screen.

```
[02] File picker  /upload  (Step 1/3)
  ↓  Upload lab report PDF
[03] OCR processing  (Step 2a)
     document_type = lab_report
     → skips review, jumps straight to AI analysis in-flight
[05] AI analysis loading  ("Analysing your report…")
  ↓  /api/analyse returns LabReportExplanation
     AbnormalMarkerCard(s) or "All Clear" card + DoctorNotes
  ↓  "Save to My Account  Free" → localStorage → /auth?mode=signup
```

> Lab reports skip the review step because the test values need no human correction  they're numeric and the user can't meaningfully edit them.

---

## Flow 3  Authenticated Upload (Prescription)

User is signed in. Document saved with full AI explanation in one flow.

```
[12] Dashboard  /dashboard
  ↓  "+ Upload for yourself" or "Upload a Prescription" (empty state)
  ↓  → /dashboard/upload/[profileId]

[02] File picker  (same component as public)
  ↓  Upload photo / PDF / enter manually
[03] OCR processing
  ↓  document_type = prescription
[04] Prescription review  (editable fields)
  ↓  confirm
[05] AI explanation loading  (/api/explain)
  ↓  explanation ready
     MedicationCards + DoctorNotes + "Save Prescription" button
  ↓  save:
       1. Upload file → Supabase Storage  medical-documents/{userId}/{ts}.ext
       2. savePrescription() → documents row + document_analyses row (with rich explanation)
          + prescriptions row + medications rows
  ↓  redirect → /dashboard?profile=[profileId]
```

**Error paths:**
- File storage upload fails gracefully → file_url = 'ocr-extracted', save still proceeds
- savePrescription() fails → saveError shown inline, stays on explanation screen
- Explanation API fails → error screen with retry + go-back

---

## Flow 4  Authenticated Upload (Lab Report)

```
[12] Dashboard  /dashboard
  ↓  → /dashboard/upload/[profileId]

[02] File picker
  ↓  Upload lab report
[03] OCR processing
  ↓  document_type = lab_report
[07] Lab report review  (all test values with reference ranges, editable)
  ↓  confirm
[05] AI analysis loading  (/api/analyse)
  ↓  analysis ready
[08] Lab analysis result  (AbnormalMarkerCards + full test table + DoctorNotes)
     "Save Lab Report" button
  ↓  saveLabReport() → documents + document_analyses (abnormalMarkers stored in key_findings)
  ↓  redirect → /records/[documentId]
```

> Lab report AI explanations (per-marker plain-language text) are stored in
> `document_analyses.key_findings.abnormalMarkers`. The `values_out_of_range`
> column only holds `{name, result, status}` for the dashboard Lab Alert card.

---

## Flow 5  Sign Up (Direct, No Upload)

```
[01] Landing homepage
  ↓  "Create Account"
[10] Auth page  /auth?mode=signup
  ↓  email + password  or  Google OAuth
[Onboarding] Enter full name  /onboarding
  ↓  submit → onboarding_completed = true
[09] Dashboard  empty state  /dashboard
  ↓  "Add a Profile" or "Upload a Prescription"
```

---

## Flow 6  Sign In (Returning User)

```
[10] Auth page  /auth  (default: sign-in tab)
  ↓  email + password  or  Google OAuth
     returnTo param respected (e.g. came from /upload → goes back to /dashboard)

```

---

## Flow 7  View a Saved Record

Single unified page. Explanation and share are inline  no secondary navigation.

```
[12] Dashboard  (or [13] Timeline)
  ↓  tap a document row

[14+15] Record detail  /records/[id]
  ┌─ PRESCRIPTION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Nav bar: ← back | "Prescription" | WhatsApp icon (top-right)      │
  │  Meta: date · doctor name · "For [patient]" · diagnosis tags       │
  │  Disclaimer banner (AI-generated, consult doctor)                  │
  │  Medications section:                                               │
  │    → Rich: MedicationCard × n  (colored box, expandable details)   │
  │      Each card: name, dosage, frequency pill, "View details" →     │
  │        Treats / How to take / Side effects / Avoid                  │
  │    → Fallback: plain name+dosage list  (legacy records)            │
  │  "Things to tell your doctor"  (DoctorNotes)                       │
  │  "View original document" link  (if file stored, not OCR-only)     │
  │  "Share via WhatsApp" full-width green button                      │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ┌─ LAB REPORT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Nav bar: ← back | "Lab Report" | (no share)                      │
  │  Meta: date · lab name / doctor · "For [patient]"                  │
  │  Disclaimer banner                                                  │
  │  Parameters Outside Normal Range:                                  │
  │    → AbnormalMarkerCard × n  (colored, with AI explanation)        │
  │    → "All Clear" card  (if all normal)                             │
  │  All Results table  (every test with value, unit, ref range)       │
  │  "Things to follow"  (DoctorNotes)                                 │
  │  "View original document" link  (if file stored)                   │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**On-demand explanation fallback:**
If a prescription record was saved without rich AI data (legacy records or edge cases),
the page calls `generateExplanation()` on first view, shows the rich cards, and saves
the result back to DB so subsequent views are instant. No LLM call after that.

> `/explanation/[id]` redirects to `/records/[id]`  both URLs reach the same page.
